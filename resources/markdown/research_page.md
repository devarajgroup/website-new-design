###Research Overview
As our molecular understanding of biology improves, new tools will be needed to further probe and understand life at the molecular length scale. Our interdisciplinary research group focuses on chemical biology with an emphasis on developing novel reactions for addressing questions in bottom-up synthetic biology and molecular imaging. Below we summarize some of our research interests.

###Hybrid Artificial Cells
A major goal of our research program is to integrate synthetic and biological components to create a hybrid artificial cell. We propose to construct “minimal cells” in which only the necessary biochemical components are combined with a self-reproducing artificial chassis. These efforts will result in the development of a fully abiotic, dynamic “cell” with programmable genetic content. The proposed work will lay the groundwork for the development of scalable biomimetic systems that may one day surpass the functionality of fully biological constructs. Such advanced materials will find practical applications as bioreactors, sensors, and drug delivery vehicles.

Synthetic biology research has long aimed to engineer genetic circuits in biological systems. Bacteria or yeast hosts have typically provided the necessary cellular “chassis” — enzymatic machinery, energy sources, and an enclosed membrane. Engineered circuits are designed to function independent of this chassis, yet the number of host networks is typically far more complex than that of the engineered design. This presents a fundamental limit on the robustness and complexity of engineered designs due to unaccounted for host interactions and context dependent circuit performance. The development of artificial cells as synthetic chassis would eliminate unnecessary and confounding background activity.

###De Novo Vesicle Formation
Natural cells have a number of mechanisms to organize biochemical pathways, one of the most prominent being membrane compartmentalization. All living cells utilize membranes to define physical boundaries, control transport, and perform signal transduction. We are devleoping and exploring novel reactions that can trigger de novo vesicle formation and reproduction. While many of the reactions we study are not prebiotically plausible, we believe such studies could reveal some of the fundamental chemical principles that led to the origin of life. Furthermore, we are studying how such reactions could improve our ability to study membrane localized structures and processes.

###Bioorthogonal Reactions
There is tremendous interest in developing and refining methods to predictably perform chemical reactions within the framework of living systems. We are actively involved in developing and applying bioorthogonal chemistries such as tetrazine cycloadditions to live cell and in vivo chemistry. We are developing new syntheses of tetrazine and dienophile precursors that are useful for bioconjugation studies.

###Design of Imaging Probes
An emerging area is the use of tetrazine ligations for the development of in vivo imaging probes such as those used for positron emission tomography. We are developing applications involving tetrazine cycloadditions performed in live mice for pretargeted imaging of cancer cell biomarkers. Such technology would aid the primary diagnosis and screening of diseases such as prostate and colon cancer, for which current PET imaging agents are not particularly useful due to insufficient signal to background. Imaging agents often fail because of low target abundance coupled to the presence of high background. A large number of exquisite targeting ligands, such as monoclonal antibodies, have slow uptake and clearance kinetics, which is undesirable for in vivo imaging with commonly available short-lived PET radiolabels. It would therefore be of enormous scientific and clinical interest to develop a flexible platform technology for in vivo targeting of such ligands once they have bound to their partner. We and others have recently developed the use of tetrazine cycloadditions as a next generation rapid bioorthogonal targeting platform. This coupling technology offers unprecedented improvement over previous conjugation approaches with respect to its rapid speed, small size of reactive partners (<200 Da), and versatile biocompatibility.
