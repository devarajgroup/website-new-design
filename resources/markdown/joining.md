###GRADUATE STUDENTS
There are positions open for talented UCSD graduate students who are members of the following graduate programs:

Chemistry and Biochemistry
Bioengineering

Areas of interest include chemical biology, molecular imaging, synthetic biology, and electrochemistry. As we are a very interdisciplinary group, emphasis will be placed on the quality of the candidates rather than the area of expertise.

Please email ndevaraj@ucsd.edu to arrange a meeting to discuss research interests.

###POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS
We have openings for talented postdoctoral fellows. Areas of interest include chemical biology, molecular imaging, synthetic biology, and electrochemistry. As we are a very interdisciplinary group, emphasis will be placed on the quality of the candidate. Salary is commensurate with experience and based on the NIH pay scale.

###UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS
We often accept undergraduates looking for research experience that qualifies as course credit (199). We are typically looking for sophomores or freshmen who are interested in staying until graduation. We operate in a very driven environment and at least 25 hours a week are expected of undergraduate workers. Contact me with your CV at nderavaj@ucsd.edu, and if an opening is available, I will pass it along to the lab's graduate students and postdocs for consideration.
